##Exercise 35 : Directive Communication

##Summary
You know that both: a car and bus are a types of vehicle. Moreover it can be said that 'audi' is a typical car brand while 'jelcz' is a typical bus brand. 
You start with three ready directives (`vehicle`, `car` and `bus`) and two uncompleted directives (`audi` and `jelcz`).

##Goals
* Add required directives to **audi** and **jelcz**
* Add directives to **index.html** based on the summary description 
* When `Drive` button is pressed, you should see message: `I am fast ... etc.` (into **h3** tags)
* When `Emergency brake` button is clicked and emergency brake exist in vehicle, you should see alert message: `Beeeeeeep`
