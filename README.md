##Exercise 1 : Binding
The goal of this exercise is use **angular binding** to connect the text field and row of the table.

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-binding](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-binding)
* **bootstrap classes** that will be used for coloring table cells [contextual classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables)

###Exercise
1. In index.html:
    * Use **ng-model** directive in input fields ( ```first, second, third```) 
    * To each row of the table add **class**  attribute and connect them with the relevant inputs.
    * Check that the rows change color by typing in the name of **bootstrap classes** - you can find examples in the field **placeholder** (```info, success, danger```)

###Completion
You are supposed to display three inputs binded as class names in each row of the example table. When You enter bootstrap class into each of the inputs
application should change relevant row to entered class(visible row alteration).

### + Bonus task
Try to connect input fields with columns of the table.

Good luck!
