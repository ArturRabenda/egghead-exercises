##Exercise 33b: ng-repeat and $index, $event, $log

Your job is to practise **ng-repeat** directive with $index, $event and $log.

###Requirements
* display all the elements from the **list**
* list items should be numbered from 1
* use **$index** as **id** 
* add appropriate class to buttons (use **addClass()** function)
* after pressing the **'Do nothing** button, you should see the message with coordinates
* after pressing the **'Show log** button, you should be redirected to **checkLog.html** page
* on **checkLog.html** page you should see **log** in console (update **display** function, don't use **console.log**)

###Results
