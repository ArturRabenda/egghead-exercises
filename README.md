##Exercise 24 : $routeProvider

##Summary
AngularJS's ngView is a directive that complements the $route service by including the rendered template of the current route into the main layout (typically the index.html) file.
Your task will be to set up routing in this simple application.

##Goals
 * configure the routing to display `home.html` page with `message` from controller at `/` path
 * DON'T change `home.html` file and `RouteCtrl`

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-ng-view](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-ng-view)

##Setup
You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. First, run sequentially

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To start the application, run

```
grunt serve
```

To start cucumber tests, run sequentially in separate terminals the application and command

```
grunt test
```

###ngRoute
* pay attention on **AngularJS 1.2.x Routing Changes: ngRoute** below the movie
* add `angular-route.js` from `bower_components` to index.html 
* add `ngRoute` dependency to application

Good luck!
