The goal of this exercise is practise writing directive, factory and controllers

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-ng-view](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-ng-view)
* and again install bower ```bower install```

###Exercise
* add dependency ```ngRoute``` to your module
* with using directive ```ng-view``` change ```templateUrl``` to ```correct.html``` and ```controller``` to ```appCtrl```
* add a button in ```correct.html``` to display ```message``` from controller

Good luck!
