#Exercise 21 : scope vs $scope

##Summary
In this application existed two directives on the same view, but in here we encountered the problem - when complement one `input` automatically completes the second input.

##Goals
 * you can NOT change the **templates** directives.
 * you can NOT change the **index.html**.
 * you should be able to insert two different values for the inputs and display it by clicking on the corresponding button.

###Before you start, please refer to:

Good luck!
