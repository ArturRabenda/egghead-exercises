#Exercise 14 : Directive to Directive Communication

## Summary
In this exercise, your challenge is to share information between directives. 

You are supposed to create four directives:
`alarm` (main directive with controller), `red`, `yellow` and `green`.

Implement a functionality that will allow you to call alerts. When you click on red circle, double click on yellow circle and when the mouse hovers over the 
green circle. 

##Goals
* main directive should have a controller with three function (with names like pattern **addColorName**)
* the content of the alarms is a simple message ***"ColorName alarm!"***
* use directive in prepared div elements (check comment)
