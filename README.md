#Exercise 21 : scope vs $scope

##Summary
In this application there are two directives working on the same scope. The final working application displays two inputs with different values.

##Goals

* a value in the first input also displays in the second one. The desired behavior is to have two separeted inputs.
* they are using the same model
* you should edit only  `scope.js` file but not the directive's template

##Before you start, please refer to
* [angularjs-scope-vs-scope](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-scope-vs-scope)

##Setup
You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. First, run sequentially

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To start the application, run

```
grunt serve
```

To start cucumber tests, run sequentially in separate terminals the application and command

```
grunt test
```

Good luck!
