##Exercise 52: transformResponse

##Summary
You start with broken application that should displayed list of GitHub users (with avatar, login, url repository and GitHub user type). All you need to do is
 transform response data from `https://api.github.com/users` to reach specific data

##Goals
* `apiResponse` factory should transform response data to form only with avatar, login, url repository and GitHub user type
* `api` factory should use transformed data
* take a look at ready view to get names of `user` properties

* [angularjs-transformresponse](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-transformresponse)
* run ```bower install``` command

Good luck!
