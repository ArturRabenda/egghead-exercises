##Exercise 39 : Animating the Angular Way
Use directive to abstract that view logic cleanly using $animate. You start with a square divided into smaller white squares. 
Big square should look like a checkerboard and by clicking the "Do you want to play?" button, all fields should change the color on the opposite.

###Requirements
* create **reverseColor** function responsible for switching colors when "Do you want to play?" button was pressed 
* in **chessboardField** directive you should observe whether the button was clicked, to add or remove class **.field**

###Result
* you start with view

* button was pressed
