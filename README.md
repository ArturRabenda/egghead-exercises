##Exercise 31 : Injectors

##Summary
Application displays song details with two modes o **sing** and **fake**. After clicking **sing** you should see `But you did not have to cut
 me off... But you treat me like a stranger ...` message. In the second case, you should see `Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut you niah niah blah bla ...`
 

##Goals
Your task is to remove `Song` attribute from `SongCtrl` and use injector so that the application behaves in the same way.

##Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-injectors](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-injectors)

 ```
 npm install
 ```
 
 ```
 bower install
 ```
 
 To run the application:
 
 ```
 grunt serve
 ```
 
To run unit tests:

 ```
 grunt karma
 ```
 
Good luck!
