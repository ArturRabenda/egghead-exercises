##Exercise 48: Testing a Service
Test simple service (**CalculatorService**)

###Requirements
* test each function in a separate **describe** (use function name)
* check that the functions are protected in exceptional cases (such as division by zero return false) - write the appropriate test (if the function does not pass the test, fix it)

###Result
You should test the 4 basic mathematical operations and division by zero security.

### Test Configuration:
* ```npm install```
* ```bower install```
* Run -> Edit Configuration -> Press plus button -> Pick up Node.js
* set JavaScript file to ```node_modules\karma\bin\karma```
* set Application parameters to ```start test\karma.conf.js```
