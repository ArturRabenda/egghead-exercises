##Exercise 1 : Binding
The goal of this exercise is use **angular binding** to connect the text field and row of the table.

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-binding](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-binding)
* **bootstrap classes** that will be used for coloring table cells [contextual classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables)

###Exercise
* Use **ng-model** directive in input fields ( ```first, second, third```) 
* To each row of the table add **class**  attribute and connect them with the relevant inputs.
* Check that the rows change color by typing in the name of **bootstrap classes** - you can find examples in the field **placeholder** (```active, success, warning```)

### + Bonus task
Try to connect input fields with columns of the table.

Good luck!
