##Exercise 17: An alternative approach to controllers

An alternative approach to controllers assumes that function should be assigned to controller, not to the $scope. You task is to implement functionality according
to the regulations below.

###Requirements

* **Calc.js** contain ***SumCtrl*** and ***SubCtrl*** controllers
* **SumCtrl** have ***add*** function assigned to itself, which requires two params and return their value as a sum (a + b)
* **SubCtrl** have ***subtraction*** function assigned to itself, which requires two params and return their value as subtracted (a - b)
* Use **add** with **firstNumberSum** and **secondNumberSum** params and display the result in correct header (check comments) when Sum button is clicked
* Use **subtraction** with **firstNumberSub** and **secondNumberSub** params and display the result in correct header (check comments) when Subtraction button is clicked
