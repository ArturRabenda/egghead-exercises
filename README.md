##Exercise 3 : Sharing data between controllers

##Summary
Controllers often need to communicate and share data. You are given a task to create functionality to share data between two controllers.
Modify **index.html file** to share data between **LeftCtrl** and **RightCtrl**.

##Goal
Add **ng-controller's** and **ng-model's** in appropriate place. Remember that all inputs should be binded to the same property and update when you type something either in left or right input.

| My Value     	| My Value       	|
|--------------	|----------------	|
| My Value 	| My Value  	|

##Setup
You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt`  packages to run this example. First, run sequentially:

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To start the application, run

```
grunt serve
```

To run the tests you need to run (in a separate terminal) the application and command
 
```
grunt test
```
