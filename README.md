##Exercise 21 : scope vs $scope

##The goal
In this application existed two directives on the same view, but in here we encountered the problem.
When complement one ```input``` automatically completes the second input.

####Requirements
 * You can NOT change the **templates** directives.
 * You can NOT change the **index.html**.
 * You should be able to insert two different values for the inputs and display it by clicking on the corresponding button.
