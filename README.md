##Exercise 3 : Sharing data between controllers

The goal of this exercise is to present the data exchange between controllers.

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-the-dot](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-the-dot)
* [angularjs-sharing-data-between-controllers](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-sharing-data-between-controllers)


###Exercise
* Based on the video **angularjs-the-dot** make changes to the **index.html** file to connect (bind) all three inputs to each other.
* Comment out the **CENTER** div in **index.html**, which will make typing text into the **left** input will not display a **right** 
* In **controllers.js** add a ***bind*** module
* Create a **factory** that returns variable **direction**
```
{direction: "Direction? Left and right!"}
```
* Based on the video **angularjs-sharing-data-between-controllers** edit controllers **LeftCtrl** and **RightCtrl**

###Completion
Expected result of this exercise is to display two inputs binded together by a factory variable model with default value.

Good luck!
