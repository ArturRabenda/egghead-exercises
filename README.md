#Exercise 32 : Components And Containers

##Summary
You start work with three "book-about" ready directives : `bookTitle`, `bookDescription` and `bookPages` . Use them to create a book consisting of
title, description and number of pages (in this order).

##Goals
* `book` directive should be used as a container
* example book's title: `The Da Vinci Code`
* book should have **454** pages

##Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-components-and-containers](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-components-and-containers)


##Setup
 You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. To resolve dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To run the application:

```
grunt serve
```

To run cucumber tests:

```
grunt test
```

Good luck!
