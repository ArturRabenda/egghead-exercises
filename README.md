#Exercise 32 : Components And Containers

##Summary
You start work with three "book-about" ready directives : `bookTitle`, `bookDescription` and `bookPages`. Use them to create a book consisting of a title, description and number of pages (in this order).

##Goals
* `book` component should be used as a container 
* set book title component with the following text **The Da Vinci Code**
* the number of pages should be **454** 
* **remember!** you are not supposed to put the book title etc. inside the `book` directive template


##Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-components-and-containers](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-components-and-containers)

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To run the application:

```
grunt serve
```

To run cucumber tests:

```

Good luck!
