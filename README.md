#Exercise 21 : scope vs $scope

##Summary
In this application existed two directives on the same view, but in here we encountered the problem - when complement one `input` automatically completes the second input.

##Goals
 * don't make any change in the **templates** of directives and  **index.html** view.
 * you should be able to insert two different values for the inputs and display it by clicking the corresponding button.

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-scope-vs-scope](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-scope-vs-scope)

##Setup
You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. First, run sequentially

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To start the application, run

```
grunt serve
```

To start cucumber tests, run sequentially in separate terminals the application and command

```
grunt test
```

Good luck!
