# Exercise 43 : Unit Testing AngularJS

    * `withoutSpace` filter that removes all spaces
    * `onlyFirstLetterUp` filter that converts the first letter of the sentence to the large ones
    
* complete `filter` describe with three describes that correspond to the filter's name 
* don't forget about adding the model before test cases
