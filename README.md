##The goal

HTML elements often change their appearance. Write a directive which, depending on the entered values will change the class specified in directive input.

####Requirements
 * The directive should be restricted as element.
 * When you display the page you should only be able to see template in code, not the directive element itself
 * The directive should react to any change in inner **input**.
 * When the **input** value is set to: *circle* or *square*, element class should be changed respectively on a ```circle``` or ```square```.
 * In other cases, it should display a red message *```Not written a circle or square```* (using **text-danger** class).
