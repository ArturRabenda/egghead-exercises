###Exercise
* with using ```ng-if``` in your script you display button that, when after clicked displays the content ```!(!value || 0 === value.length);```
(you don't use $watch complete function ```isTitleVisible```)
* you must set correct properties in directive
* use directive```<url title="{{title}}">The content is: {{content}}</url>```
* in ```templateUrl``` you must hide content with using ```ng-show``` ```<div ng-show="isContentVisible" ng-transclude></div>```
