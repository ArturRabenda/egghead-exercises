#Exercise 2 : Controller

##Summary
Applications often need to display value that user have entered. You are provided with simple view containing title, three inputs and display board. Your task is to
implement functionality that will allow inputs to be displayed along with the information on the title and board.

##Goals
* application should contain `FruitCtrl` controller
* on `FruitCtrl` scope there are binded properties: `seller, name, count` with example default values
* comments in `index.html` are replaced by appropriate values from the inputs

##Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-controller](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-controllers)

##Setup
 You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. First, run sequentially:
 
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 
 ```
 bower install
 ```
 
 To start the application, run
 
 ```
 grunt serve
 ```
 
To start cucumber tests, run sequentially in separate terminals the application and command

 ```
 grunt test
 ```
 
Good luck!
