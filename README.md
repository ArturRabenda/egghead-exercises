#Exercise 1 : Binding

##Summary
Application displays three inputs and the artists table. In table, each class attribute of the row is binded to one of the input values by order.

##Goals
* **First place** input value updates class of the first row
* **Second place** input value updates class of the second row
* **Third place** input value updates class of the third row

###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-binding](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-binding)
* **bootstrap classes** that will be used for coloring table cells [contextual classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables)

### + Bonus task
Try to connect input fields with columns of the table.

##Setup
 You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. First, run sequentially:
 
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 
 ```
 bower install
 ```
 
 To start the application, run
 
 ```
 grunt serve
 ```
 
To start cucumber tests, run sequentially in separate terminals the application and command

 ```
 grunt test
 ```
 
Good luck!
