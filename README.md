###Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-thinking-differently-about-organization](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-thinking-differently-about-organization)

###Exercise
* check how the application work before changes
* add to ```Calc.js``` **calcAppElements** object, which will be a container of our controllers and directives
* add to ```calcAppElements``` empty **controllers** and **directives** object
* switch controllers and directors form as it was presented in the video
* at the end, add directives to ```calcApp.directive``` like this ```calcApp.directive(calcAppElements.directives);```
* do the same with controllers
* check how the application work after changes

Good luck!
