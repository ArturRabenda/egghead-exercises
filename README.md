###Exercise

* Test **orderBy**, **limitTo** filters (according to the attribute your chosen) and **lowercase**, **uppercase** filters. 
* Use **choice** (it uses by **ng-click** directive with **orderBy** as an orgument, which allows you to sort by column)
* Similarly use **limit** model as argumet **limitTo** to restrict the display of the radio choice.

Good luck!
